    <p>
        I see the focus on UX Design and Human/Computer Interaction as being a necessary step in the evolution of technology. Tech's promise to unite humanity through the internet, to simplify people's lives through access to information and automation (among other things) has been tainted by the disruptive effects it has had on social systems. Instead of uniting people, they feel increasingly lonely and inadequate. Instead of informing people, it opened the floodgates for misinformation and manipulation. A lot of these problems stem from the fact that engineers and coders simply do not account for the social aspects of their platforms, and are building them with visions of profitability rather than a comprehensive understanding of the ways their systems change the people using them.  Every single computer-based platform, from financial tools to eBooks to Facebook, requires users to interact with it in ways that affect and encourage certain outcomes. I would like to build a comprehensive understanding of the design of said programs and use this knowledge to create more natural, responsible, and productive technology.

        I would also like to use this knowledge in government, potentially working to bridge the deep divides between government institutions and the internet, thus allowing people to feel connected to a government that is less abstract and more responsive. I believe strongly that tech literacy is one of the largest shortcomings of our current national government, and I hope that I can help -- through this degree and more -- to develop a more productive regulatory structure, and by extension, more productive technology that works for a greater number of people.
